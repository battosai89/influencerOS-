This document outlines the strategic product roadmap for InfluencerOS. It is a living document inspired by best-in-class project management tools and unique, industry-specific innovations that will provide our users with a significant competitive advantage.

---

### **Phase 1: Core Experience Enhancements (Short-Term)**

**Goal:** Solidify the foundation by implementing the powerful, flexible project management features users expect from a modern SaaS tool.

-   **Visual Status Boards (Kanban View):**
    -   Implement a Kanban-style board for campaigns, allowing users to drag-and-drop projects through customizable stages (e.g., Planning, Outreach, Content Creation, Live, Completed).
    -   Add color-coded priority and status tags.

-   **Advanced Task Management:**
    -   Introduce task dependencies (e.g., "Content Creation" is blocked until "Contract Signed").
    -   Add subtasks and checklists to break down larger tasks.
    -   Create a "My Tasks" view for team members to see their personal assignments.

-   **Timeline / Gantt View:**
    -   Develop a visual timeline view for campaigns to manage schedules and deadlines effectively.

-   **Flexible Data Views (Notion-Style):**
    -   Allow users to switch between different views for their data (e.g., view Influencers as a grid, table, or Kanban board).
    -   Implement an advanced filtering system (e.g., "Show me fashion creators with >50k followers who are available in July").

-   **Custom Properties & Fields:**
    -   Enable users to add custom fields to influencers, brands, and campaigns (e.g., internal rating, rate range, preferred contact method).

### **Phase 2: Collaboration & Automation (Mid-Term)**

**Goal:** Transform the application from a single-player tool into a multi-player, collaborative hub that saves teams significant time.

-   **Team Collaboration Features:**
    -   Implement user roles and permissions (Admin, Manager, Viewer).
    -   Add @mentions and comment threads on campaigns, tasks, and clients.
    -   Integrate a centralized file sharing system for creative assets.

-   **Client Collaboration Portals:**
    -   Build a secure, white-labeled portal where clients can log in to view campaign progress.
    -   Create a built-in content proofing and approval workflow with visual annotation tools.

-   **Workflow Automation Engine:**
    -   Develop a simple "trigger-action" automation system (e.g., "When campaign status changes to 'Completed', automatically generate a draft invoice").
    -   Introduce recurring tasks (e.g., "Generate monthly performance report").

-   **Workflow Templates:**
    -   Create pre-built, customizable templates for common agency processes like "New Campaign Launch" or "Creator Onboarding."

### **Phase 3: The Competitive Moat (Long-Term & Visionary)**

**Goal:** Implement unique, AI-powered, and industry-specific features that make InfluencerOS indispensable and impossible for generic PM tools to compete with.

-   **AI-Powered Predictive Insights:**
    -   **Creator Performance Prediction:** An AI model that suggests which influencers are most likely to perform well for a specific brand's campaign.
    -   **Predictive Forecasting:** More advanced revenue and churn prediction models.

-   **Market Intelligence Tools:**
    -   **Rate Benchmarking:** Provide users with real-time market data on what to pay influencers based on niche, platform, and follower count.
    -   **Competitor Campaign Tracking:** An AI agent that monitors and reports on campaigns being run by competitor agencies and brands.
    -   **Seasonal Trend Analysis:** Proactively identify which niches and content types perform best during different times of the year.

-   **Advanced Creator Vetting:**
    -   **Brand Safety Scoring:** Automatically scan a creator's past content for potential brand safety risks.
    -   **Engagement Quality Analysis:** An AI tool to help distinguish between authentic engagement and fake followers/bots.

-   **Deeper Integrations:**
    -   **Social Media APIs:** Directly import performance data from platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
    -   **Accounting Software:** Sync financial data with QuickBooks, Xero, etc.
    -   **Email Integration:** Allow users to create tasks or log communications directly from their Gmail or Outlook inbox.
