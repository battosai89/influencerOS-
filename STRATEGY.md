# Strategic Go-to-Market Plan: InfluencerOS

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for taking `InfluencerOS` from its current state as a single-user prototype to a successful, multi-tenant, money-making SaaS platform.

Our philosophy is to work on parallel tracks: while we build the necessary backend infrastructure, we will also build the public-facing assets (like the landing page) so we can start marketing before the product is even finished.

---

### **Phase 1: Core App Refinement & Pre-Launch Preparation (Now)**

Before we integrate the backend, we must prepare the current application. This is like reinforcing the foundation of a house before adding new floors.

1.  **Solidify the Data Model:** We will review our `types.ts` file one last time to ensure it perfectly represents the data our users will need. This file will become the blueprint for our database tables.
2.  **Componentize Everything:** We will ensure all UI elements are clean, reusable components. This will make it much easier to plug in real data later.
3.  **State Management Cleanup:** We will audit our `useStore` (Zustand) file to separate what is *global UI state* (e.g., is the command bar open?) from what will become *server data* (e.g., the list of influencers).
4.  **Build a Pre-Launch "Coming Soon" Page:** While we work, we will deploy a simple, elegant landing page with a single goal: **collecting emails**. It will have a compelling headline ("The AI-Powered OS for Modern Influencer Agencies"), a few key feature descriptions, and a form to sign up for the beta waitlist. This starts our marketing on Day 1.

### **Phase 2: The Public Face & First Impression (Parallel Track)**

This is where we build our sales pitch and user onboarding experience.

1.  **Build the Full Landing Page:** This is our digital storefront. It will be a separate part of the application and will include:
    *   **Hero Section:** A powerful headline and a call-to-action (CTA) to "Start Your Free Trial."
    *   **Features/Benefits:** Visually stunning sections that showcase what `InfluencerOS` does (AI Assistant, Snap-to-Grid Dashboard, Client Management, etc.).
    *   **Social Proof:** Placeholder sections for future customer testimonials.
    *   **Pricing:** A clear, three-tiered pricing table (e.g., Free, Pro, Agency).
    *   **FAQ:** Answering common questions to reduce friction.

2.  **Design the Onboarding Flow:** This is the most critical part of the user experience. When a new user signs up, they will not be dropped into a blank dashboard. Instead, they will go through a guided setup:
    *   **Step 1: Welcome:** A clean welcome message.
    *   **Step 2: Key Questions:** We will ask a few simple questions to personalize their workspace. This is where your idea comes to life.
        *   *"What's the name of your agency?"* (This will brand their workspace).
        *   *"What is your primary role?"* (This helps us tailor future features).
        *   *"Which of these is your biggest challenge right now?"* (e.g., Finding New Influencers, Managing Contracts, Tracking ROI). The answer to this question will **automatically pre-populate their dashboard** with the most relevant widgets. This creates an immediate "aha!" moment.
    *   **Step 3: Guided Tour:** A quick, dismissible tour that points out the main features (Dashboard, Create New button, AI Assistant).

### **Phase 3: Building the SaaS Engine (The Heavy Lifting)**

This is where we integrate Supabase and Stripe to make the application a true multi-tenant SaaS.

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Create new projects in Supabase and Stripe.
    *   Securely manage all API keys and environment variables. We will have separate keys for our local development, a testing/staging environment, and the final live production environment.

2.  **Database Schema & RLS:**
    *   Translate our `types.ts` file into a database schema in Supabase.
    *   Add a `user_id` or `organization_id` column to every relevant table.
    *   **Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies.** This is non-negotiable and is what creates the secure walls between each user's data.

3.  **Authentication:**
    *   Build the Sign Up, Login, and Forgot Password pages using Supabase Auth.
    *   Protect all application routes so that only logged-in users can access them.

4.  **Data Migration:**
    *   Go through the entire application, component by component, and **rip out all calls to the mock data**.
    *   Replace them with asynchronous calls to the Supabase client to fetch and update live data. The UI will now display real, persistent data specific to the logged-in user.

5.  **Stripe Integration:**
    *   Define our subscription plans in the Stripe dashboard.
    *   Build the Supabase Edge Functions that will communicate securely with the Stripe API.
    *   Integrate Stripe Checkout into our "Upgrade" buttons.
    *   Build the crucial **webhook handler** (another Edge Function) that listens for successful payments from Stripe and updates the user's subscription status in our Supabase database.

### **Phase 4: The Test Environment & Beta Launch**

We will **never** test in the live environment.

1.  **Staging Environment:** We will deploy a complete, functional copy of the application to a private "staging" URL. This environment will connect to Supabase and Stripe in "test mode."
2.  **Rigorous Testing:** We will simulate user sign-ups, create data, and process fake payments. We will perform two critical tests:
    *   **Data Isolation Test:** We will create two test user accounts (User A and User B) and do everything possible to make User A access User B's data. Our RLS policies must prevent this.
    *   **Payment Flow Test:** We will run through the entire subscription lifecycle: upgrading, downgrading, and canceling, all using Stripe's test credit card numbers.
3.  **Beta Launch:** Once we are confident, we will invite the users from our pre-launch waitlist (from Phase 1) to a closed beta. This gives us invaluable feedback from real users before the public launch.

### **Phase 5: Launch, Market, and Earn Money**

1.  **Public Launch:** We will switch our Supabase and Stripe environments from "test" to "live" mode and deploy the application to our main domain.
2.  **Marketing:** We will execute our marketing plan, which can include launching on Product Hunt, writing blog posts about influencer marketing (repurposing our Academy content), and engaging with potential customers on social media.
3.  **Feedback & Iteration:** We will install analytics tools to see how users are interacting with the app. We will continuously collect feedback to inform our roadmap and build the features our paying customers want most.
